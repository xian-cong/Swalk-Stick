# Swalk Stick
### Introduction
**Swalk Stick** (Smart Walking Stick) idea was originally designed and prototyped by **The Innovative 3**, consist of Koay Xian Cong, Lim Wei Chung and Crement Ong in December 2016. The first design was originally prototyped using PVC pipes as a **proof of concept (POC)**. The prototype was being used to compete in Young Innovative Challenge State Level and we won the first prize. Since then, my team and I represented our school in various competitions and exhibitions with the Swalk Stick including: 
  1. Chung Ling High School Centenary
  2. Turning Research into Ideas Workshop
  3. International Technology & Science Symposium at Penang, Malaysia
  4. SIRIM Technology Expo
  5. Penang International Science Fair
  6. STEM Carnival Invention Competition
  7. Presented to Royal Princess from Thailand, Maha Chakri Sirindhorn
  8. Presented to the ambassador of Hungary to Malaysia, Petra Ponevacs-Pana

### Design
The first generation Swalk Stick was mainly used as a POC rather than making it looked like a real product. During second generation, our team grew bigger and Owen Loh designed the second generation Swalk Stick using AutoCAD which can be found [here](https://github.com/xian-cong/Swalk-Stick/blob/main/Walking-Stick-full-3D.dwg). The 3D design is shown below.
