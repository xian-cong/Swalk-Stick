# Swalk Stick
### Introduction
**Swalk Stick** (Smart Walking Stick) idea was originally designed and prototyped by **The Innovative 3**, consist of Koay Xian Cong, Lim Wei Chung and Crement Ong in December 2016. The first design was originally prototyped using PVC pipes as a **proof of concept (POC)**. The prototype was being used to compete in Young Innovative Challenge State Level and we won the first prize. Since then, my team and I represented our school in various competitions and exhibitions with the Swalk Stick including: 
  1. Chung Ling High School Centenary
  2. Turning Research into Ideas Workshop
  3. International Technology & Science Symposium at Penang, Malaysia
  4. SIRIM Technology Expo
  5. Penang International Science Fair
  6. STEM Carnival Invention Competition
  7. Presented to Royal Princess from Thailand, Maha Chakri Sirindhorn
  8. Presented to the ambassador of Hungary to Malaysia, Petra Ponevacs-Pana

### Objectives
  1. Personal Emergency Assistant
  2. 24 hours Safety Monitor
  3. Risk Avoidance

### Functions
The Swalk Stick has 3 main functions: 
  1. Fall Detection System
  2. 24/7 Monitoring of User's position for Rapid Medical Assistance
  3. Automaed Lights at Night
  4. Obstacle Detection

### Design
The first generation Swalk Stick was mainly used as a POC rather than making it looked like a real product. During second generation, our team grew bigger and Owen Loh designed the second generation Swalk Stick using AutoCAD which can be found [here](https://github.com/xian-cong/Swalk-Stick/blob/main/Walking-Stick-full-3D.dwg) and printed out. The 3D design is shown below.
